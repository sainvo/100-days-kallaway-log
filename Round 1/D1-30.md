**Progress of the Day:** Continued to play around with JaxaFX Scene Builder to learn the basic components.                       
                            
**Thoughts:** Figured out some basics of Anchor panes, VBox, HBox, Buttons and such. The tool seems easy but it has ton of elements that need to be learned.
